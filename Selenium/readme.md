# Selenium #

To setup we need to get a driver compatible with our browser version. Either:

- GeckoDriver for Firefox.
- ChromeDrive for Chrome.
- *Amongst others.*

We also need to install:

- pip3 install selenium
- pip3 install webdriver_manager


	*webdriver_manager is being used here to avoid the 'No Firefox Version' issue. Mileage may differ.*

That should be it. Since I am using Firefox there are some basic examples in the GeckoDriver - Firefox folder.
